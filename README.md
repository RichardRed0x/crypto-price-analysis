Just some fun playing with data about cryptocurrency price volatility.

CMC files are taken from the historical data on coinmarketcap.com, for the last 2 years (from Apr 25 2019).

Daily price change is defined as the opening - closing price from CMC data, also expressed as a percentage of the opening price.
